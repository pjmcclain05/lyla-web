            Lyla combines continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with pulse and
            activity data (PPG) to show how food, insulin, sleep, stress, and
            movement affect your numbers in real life, not just on paper.

        <div class="section-header">
          <h2>Why Lyla?</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional CGM apps show numbers and alarms. Lyla focuses on
            patterns, context, and what you can actually do about it.
          </p>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="card feature-card">
            <h3>People with T1D deserve better tools.</h3>
            <p>
              Hospital visits, scary lows and unexplained highs are often
              treated as random. But your data usually has a story. Lyla pulls
              together glucose, pulse, and activity to help you see what’s
              really going on.
            </p>

          <div class="card feature-card">
            <h3>We believe you’re not the problem.</h3>
            <p>
              Our experience suggests many people with Type 1 know what they
              “should” do, they just don’t have technology that makes it easy to
              understand how daily choices impact blood sugar. Lyla is designed
              to close that gap.

      <!-- WHAT IS LYLA -->
      <section id="what-is-lyla" class="section">
        <div class="section-header">
          <h2>What is Lyla?</h2>
          <p>
            Lyla is a software layer built on top of your existing devices,
            designed to turn raw data into clear, human-readable insights.
          </p>

        <div class="grid-2">
          <div class="card feature-card">
            <h3>More than a graph of your glucose.</h3>
            <p>
              Lyla blends CGM data with PPG signals (like pulse and movement) to
              understand when you’re eating, resting, moving, or under stress
              and how those states change your blood sugar.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card feature-card">
            <h3>From reactive to proactive.</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of only reacting to alarms, Lyla helps you spot consistent
              patterns: “I always rise after this breakfast,” or “I tend to drop
              overnight after this dose” and gives you suggestions you can test
              and refine over time.
